## General Info
This repository is a collection of different exercises on supervised machine learning methods. I used different standard datasets, including the iris flower and breast cancer dataset.  

I was able to get a basic exposure to the scikit-learn library and also learn about different performance metrics, including MAE, MSE, RMSE, Coefficient of Determination, the Confusion Matrix, and more. 

ML methods I was able to familiarize with: 
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net Regression and GLM 
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* SVM
* Random Froest and Gradient Descent
